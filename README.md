# LunchOn

## Introduction:
“LunchOn” is a mobile-friendly web application aimed to simplify group lunches. We take a poll-based approach to plan the event. The host sets an initial plan, which includes details such as date and time, an approximate location, the cuisine, and the price range of the restaurant. The host then invites all members to the event, who then poll on some of these parameters. 

The polls help in communicating and recording different preferences and help gather an overall consensus and decide on the final restaurant and time. The app also has an in-app chat feature where people can discuss their opinions.
